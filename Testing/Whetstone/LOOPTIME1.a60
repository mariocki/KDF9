_c_o_m_m_e_n_t
   using the ee9 emulator
   × with KIDSGROVE ALGOL this takes 123.0 KDF9 seconds
     and executes  20000083 KDF9 instructions:
     the overhead for 0 iterations is 83 KDF9 instructions,
     so the per-loop cost is 20 KDF9 instructions per iteration.
   × with the peephole optimization of wich it takes 108.0 seconds
     and executes 18000113  KDF9 instructions;
