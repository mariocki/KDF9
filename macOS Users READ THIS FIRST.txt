If you are using macOS and have Apple's Gatekeeper anti-malware protection enabled,
macOS may try to prevent you from running the programs included in this distribution,
which it may put in "quarantine" after download because they are not cryptographically signed.

You can handle this in one of three ways:

1. Switch off Gatekeeper.  I strongly recommend that you DO NOT DO THIS!

2. Each time Gatekeeper blocks a program, go to the Security&Privacy/General option
   in System Preferences and confirm that it is OK to run it.  You will have to do this
   for each of the several ancilllary programs needed to run all the KDF9 software:
      not just ee9 but a2b, kal3, kidopt, mkchan, and mtp.
   This is tedious, but it needs to be done just the once for each of these programs.

3. The easy way: in the distributed Build directory, use the supplied shell script de40ine,
   which removes the quarantine flag, by changing to the Build directory and issuing:

      /usr/bin/xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine de40ine # this may not be needed
      ./de40ine

   You may need to run these commands with elevated privileges, depending on the privileges
   normally possessed by your user identity, thus:

      sudo /usr/bin/xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine de40ine
      sudo ./de40ine

 If you are wary about this - as you perhaps should be - read de40ine and the xattr manual page.
