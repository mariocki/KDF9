If you are using macOS and have Apple's Gatekeeper anti-malware protection enabled,
macOS may try to prevent you from running the programs included in this distribution,
which it may put in "quarantine" after download because they are not cryptographically signed.

You can handle this in one of four ways:

0. Give up.
   8-)

1. Switch off Gatekeeper.
   I strongly recommend that you DO NOT DO THIS!

2. Persuade Gatekeeper to let the program run.
   Each time Gatekeeper blocks a run, you are offered the choice of deleting the program
   (suggested in case you have downloaded malicious software) or just cancellling the run.

   CLICK ON CANCEL, then go to the Security&Privacy:General option in System Preferences,
   where you will find a button already set up to authorize running it.  Click that button.

   You should now find that that program runs successfully on a second attempt.  This is tedious,
   but deliberately so, as Apple wants people to think twice about running unauthorized software.

   You will have to do this for each of the several programs needed to run all the KDF9 software:
   not just ee9 but a2b, kal3, kidopt, mkchan, and mtp.  This is annoying, but it needs to be done
   just the once for each of these programs.

3. The easy way.
   Use the supplied shell script de40ine, which removes the quarantine flag from everything
   contained in the emulation folder and its subfolders.

   Issue these Terminal commands, using the bash (or compatible) shell:

      cd emulation/Build

      sudo ./de40ine

   and give your login password.

   That should remove Gatekeeper's quarantine from everything in one fell swoop.

   If you are wary about this - as you perhaps should be - look at the commands inside de40ine
   and then read the manual page for xattr thus:

      man xattr
