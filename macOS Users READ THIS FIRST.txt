If you are using macOS and have System Integrity Protection (SIP) enabled, macOS will try
to prevent you from running the programs included in this distribution, which it puts in
"quarantine" after download because they have not been cryptographically code-signed.

You can handle this in one of three ways:

1. Switch off Syetem Integrity Protection.  I strongly recommend that you do NOT do this!

2. Each time SIP blocks a program, go to the Security&Privacy/General option in System Preferences
   and confirm that it is OK to run it.  You will have to do this for each of the several programs
   needed to run all the KDF9 software: not just ee9 but a2b, kidopt, mkchan, mtp etc.
   This is tedious, but it needs to be done just the once for each program.

3. The easy way: in the distributed Build directory, issue these Terminal commands,
   which remove the quarantine flag:

   /usr/bin/xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine de40ine # this may not be needed
   ./de40ine

   You may need to run these commands with elevated privileges, depending on the privileges
   possessed by your user identity, thus:

   sudo /usr/bin/xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine de40ine
   sudo ./de40ine

 If you are wary about this -- as you should be -- read de40ine and read the manual page for xattr.
