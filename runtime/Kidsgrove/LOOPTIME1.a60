   using the ee9 emulator
   * with KIDSGROVE ALGOL this takes 123.0 KDF9 seconds
     and executes  20000083 KDF9 instructions:
     the overhead for 0 iterations is 83 KDF9 instructions,
     so the per-loop cost is 20 KDF9 instructions per iteration.
   * with the peephole optimization of wich it takes 108.0 seconds
     and executes 18000113  KDF9 instructions;
!integer  i;
!for  i := 1 !step  1 !until  1 000 000 !do
!end
